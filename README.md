## Objective 

This assignment makes a web page in express and allows you to take and store notes. The page is also deployed using Heroku, which allows for easy viewing.

## Changes

- Added all of necessary paths to api calls
- Added some file/database management with fs
- Added UUIDs to the notes to make them able to be deleted
- Honestly, there really wasn't much to this assignment.
